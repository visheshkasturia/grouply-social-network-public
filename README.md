```
$ cd client
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

**2. Setting up the back-end**

- Connect to MongoDB: edit the `.env` file

```
ATLAS_CONNECTION = #(Your MongoDB atlas connection
                     - example
                     -mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@<DBLINK>?retryWrites=true&w=majority)
```

## Technologies

The project primarily utilises React.js, Node.js and Express.js for some particular reasons:

- It facilitates the MVC architecture which makes web development process **scalable** and the front-end and back-end remain **decoupled**
- The framework provides lot of libraries which make development easy.
- Robust and support for testing libraries.
- Most libraries are installed locally and have low global dependencies
- One of the most popular frameworks for making web apps.
- Great documentation and support

## Routes

TODO

## Security

- Account Lockout Policy: User is given 3 tries to login following which the account is locked for 15 minutes.
- Description of HTTP status codes used: Pretty straightforward methods for naming HTTP status codes. Most of the successful API calls will send 200 status, and most failed calls will send 400. A successful POST method call will send 201 status, and a database item not found in a database collection will send 404 status.
- Cookies: Whenever a user Logs in - If successful - a cookie is set containing identifying information which is used to fetch all the user information in the home page.
- Access Control: Access control is split into members and administrators - members can only control/ edit/ delete objects associated with themselves. Admins can modify, delete objects belonging to the group.
- Using .env: No sensitive information is stored anywhere in code and .env files containing sensitive information are not pushed to github.

## Testing

- Unit tests for all APIs called from Front-end
- Unit tests for all routes in the backend
- Snapshot tests for most front-end components
